--------------------------------------------
The factorial of a number N is the product of 
N * (N - 1) * (N - 2) ... 1
and is represented by the notation N!
For example, 3! is computed as:
3 * 2 * 1 = 6

The program, factorial, computes the factorial of an integer passed in on the command line and prints the result to the terminal. Unfortunately there is a bug in the program and the factorial is not correctly computed. For example,

How many things can you find wrong and fix in this program?

To build your code change to the build directory (~/environment/coding_challenge/factorial/build/) and run 'make' in the terminal below. 

To run the executable can be run from the build directory by typing __./factorial \<some integer\>__.
