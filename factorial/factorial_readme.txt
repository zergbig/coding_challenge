The factorial of a number N is the product of 
N * (N - 1) * (N - 2) ... 1
and is represented by the notation N!
For example, 3! is computed as:
3 * 2 * 1 = 6

The program, factorial, computes the factorial of an integer passed in on the
command line and prints the result to the terminal. Unfortunately there is a bug
in the program and it is not correctly computing the factorial. For example,
if I run './factorial 6' the output is 95075280 instead of the correct answer 
of 720. 

How many things can you find wrong and fix in this program?
