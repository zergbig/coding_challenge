The program, file_writer, takes a file path on the command line and writes some
data to it. Unfortunately, depending on the file path passed in, the program
crashes. Examine the code in file_writer.cc and fix the crash.

To build your code change to the build directory (~/environment/coding_challenge/file_writer/build/) and run __make__.

The executable can be run from the build directory by typing __./file_writer__.
