reduce_number.cc contains the source code for a program that calls the stubbed-out 
function 'int reduce_number(int number)'. The goal of reduce_number(int number) is 
to take the integer passed in, find and remove the digit that will result in the 
lowest remaining integer, and return that integer.

Example: If 246 were passed in, reduce_number(246) would remove the digit 6 and
return 24. (Removing 2 would result in 46; removing 4 would result in 26; both
are larger than 24.)

Implement the function reduce_number(int number).

To build your code run 'make' in the terminal below.
To test your code run './reduce_number <some_integer>' in the terminal below. 
The return result from your implementation of 'int reduce_number(int number)' 
will be displayed.
