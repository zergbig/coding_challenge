---------------------------------------
The program, reverse, takes a string on the command line and prints out the 
reverse of that string. For example, if it is run as follows:
reverse Forcepoint

The expected output would be:
tniopecroF

Unfortunately, the algorithm for reversing strings has some bugs. Find and fix 
as many bugs as you can and ensure that the algorithm properly reverses strings.

To build your code change to the build directory 
(~/environment/reverse/factorial/build/) and run __make__.

The executable can be run from the build directory by typing 
__./reverse \<string\>__.
