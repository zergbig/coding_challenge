The program, reverse, takes a string on the command line 
and prints out the reverse of that string. For example,
if I called reverse as follows:
reverse Forcepoint

The expected output would be:
tniopecroF

Unfortunately my algorithm for reversing strings has some bugs.
Find and fix as many bugs as you can and ensure that the algorithm
properly reverses strings.
