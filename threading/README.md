The program, threading, often seg faults when it runs. Analyze the code in threading.c and fix it so that it accomplishes its same purpose and does not seg fault.

To build your code change to the build directory (~/environment/reverse/threading/build/) and run __make__. 

The executable can be run from the build directory by typing __./threading__.
